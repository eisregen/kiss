THE FILESTRUCTURE

    bin
        contains the main script 'cms' and additional, required files.

    blk
        all blocks that can be used are stored here. Besides the blocks
        themselves, additional files, like the converted HTML-Blockfiles, are
        stored here

    pgs
        the pgs directory is the home of all page HTML-files. There resides also
        files, which contains the name of all blocks used by the pages.

    tpl
        here goes every stuff you can call a template (the head.html and
        foot.html e.g.).

    web
        this is the root of the webpage itself. All the pages (and the planned
        subpages) are symlinked together here.
